<h2>Get Started</h2>
<p>The objective of <strong>HealthX Innovation Sandbox</strong> is to establish
suite of enablers including a conducive policy-ops Innovation Sandbox that
is accessible, safe, self-contained and realistic in simulating a production
environment that allow innovators to “start fast and prove fast / fail-and-recover
fast” on their innovations.</p>

<h4>Extending or Exiting the Sandbox</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Project Team can decide to exit sandbox or extend the sandbox period at
its own discretion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon exiting, the Project Team must submit a report to HealthX Innovation
Sandbox administrator @ <a href="mailto:healthx@synapxe.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">healthx@synapxe.sg</a><strong> </strong>within
1 month from the expiry of the sandbox period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HealthX Innovation Sandbox administrator will evaluate the data points
and provide its recommendation to support project exit decision based on
stats generated from the cloud services (e.g., number of users and usage,
transactions supported)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project team will “graduate” from the sandbox and may proceed to scale
the technology under experimentation in production, provided that:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the Project Team has provided an acceptable exit and transition strategy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the sandbox has achieved successful outcome in actualizing its goal and
objective (i.e., fulfil the entry and exit requirement of the project).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of the sandbox period, the Project Team must settle the HCC
billings, teardown the workloads, de-activate the account(s) and exit from
the sandbox.</p>
<p>For the purpose of transparency, relevant information of all approved
sandbox projects such as the name of the requestors, the start and end
dates of the sandbox experimentation, experimentation conclusion and exit
outcome will be included in Synapxe documentation repository as part of
the Sandbox lessons learnt and may be shared with wider innovation community
or published on Synapxe HealthX Innovation Sandbox portal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
