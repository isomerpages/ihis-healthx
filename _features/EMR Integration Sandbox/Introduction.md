<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The <strong>Next Generation Electronic Medical Record (NGEMR)</strong> is
Singapore’s national Electronic Medical Record platform based on the Epic
EMR system. As the core EMR, NGEMR is the foundation of patient care and
digital health services across public healthcare.
<br>
<br>Because NGEMR is a live production system, every integration request must
be carefully prioritized and validated. The <strong>EMR Integration Sandbox </strong>is
established within the<strong> HealthX Innovation Sandbox</strong> to support
innovators and industry partners.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide a <strong>realistic, production-like EMR interface</strong> that
simulates NGEMR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow innovators to <strong>experiment, test, and validate</strong> solutions
safely, without impacting live healthcare operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as a <strong>pathway to NGEMR integration</strong>, from initial
prototyping to production readiness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Playbook on EMR integration</h3>
<p>We are offering a practical guide to help innovators navigate NGEMR integration:
<br>1. Introduction to NGEMR – Understanding the national EMR system and its
importance.
<br>2. Integration with Sandbox APIs – Hands-on testing with preloaded data
and standardized protocols (HL7, FHIR).
<br>3. Integration using Epic APIs – Practical pathways using both open and
vendor-supported services.
<br>4. Integration with NGEMR in Production – Considerations, processes, and
case studies for scaling into the real EMR environment.</p>
