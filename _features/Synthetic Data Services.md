<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Synthetic Data Generation Service in the Health-X Innovation Sandbox
provides a secure and compliant platform to generate synthetic or test
data to support innovation experimentation closer to real-world, production-like
environments.
<br>
<br>This service is especially useful for project teams that require massive
data for machine learning model training, software testing, behavioral
simulations, and building product demos — without compromising data privacy.</p>
<h3>Why Synthetic Data?</h3>
<p>• <strong>Safe Experimentation</strong>: Enables project teams and external
collaborators to test their ideas without exposing real personal data.
<br>• <strong>Compliance Ready</strong>: Mimics the statistical structure of
real data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
<br>• <strong>High Volume &amp; Fast</strong>: Allows teams to generate large
volumes of test data quickly and efficiently.
<br>• <strong>Production-Like Testing</strong>: Simulates realistic datasets
to validate solutions in environments closer to production.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<p>• <strong>Structured Tabular Data (Phase 1)</strong>: Generation of high-quality,
synthetic tabular datasets that resemble real production data while preserving
data privacy.
<br>• <strong>Pre-Loaded Datasets</strong>: Synthetic datasets can be pre-loaded
from open sources (e.g., <a href="https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Synthea</a>)
for faster prototyping and testing.
<br>•<strong> Customizable Coverage</strong>: Configure datasets to suit your
test scenarios, such as specific demographics or use cases.
<br>• <strong>Collaboration-Friendly</strong>: Teams can download relevant
dataset copies from the HXIS Data Hub, preserving dataset integrity by
avoiding overwrite conflicts.
<br>
</p>
<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
<p>• <strong>Quality</strong>: Produce synthetic data that is balanced and
unbiased.
<br>• <strong>Productivity</strong>: Speed up the testing cycle with quickly
generated datasets.
<br>• <strong>Volume</strong>: Supplement limited or non-existent datasets.
<br>• <strong>Coverage</strong>: Enable targeted, scenario-specific testing.
<br>• <strong>Compliance</strong>: Reduce risks related to non-compliance and
sensitive data exposure.</p>
<h3>Innovation Impact</h3>
<p>• <strong>Accelerates Prototyping</strong>: Especially valuable for projects
where production data doesn’t exist yet (e.g., new applications).
<br>• <strong>Enhanced Privacy</strong>: Avoids the use of actual PII while
retaining the statistical integrity of the data.
<br>•<strong> Reuse for Multiple Scenarios</strong>: Synthetic datasets can
be reused across different test cases and projects, increasing testing
efficiency.
<br>• <strong>Data Governance Alignment</strong>: Follows governance best practices,
including data sourcing from clusters/agencies with appropriate oversight.</p>
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>Synapxe aims to expand Synthetic Data Services to support more complex
data types, including:
<br>• Unstructured data such as clinical notes
<br>• Images and video for use in computer vision and AI model development</p>
