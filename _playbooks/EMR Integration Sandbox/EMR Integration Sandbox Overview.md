<h3>EMR Integration Sandbox Overview</h3>
<p>The <strong>EMR Integration Sandbox</strong> provides a production-like
environment that simulates the <strong>Next Generation Electronic Medical Record (NGEMR)</strong> —
Singapore’s national Electronic Medical Record platform built on the Epic
EMR system and used across public healthcare institutions of Singapore.
NGEMR serves as the backbone for safe, seamless, and coordinated patient
care.
<br>
<br>The sandbox enables innovators to explore, test, and validate integrations
safely before connecting to the live NGEMR environment. It allows innovators
to:
<br>• <strong>Experiment and test integrations</strong> without risk to live
operations.
<br>• <strong>Validate and refine solutions early</strong> using test/synthetic
data and realistic clinical workflows.
<br>• <strong>Accelerate readiness for NGEMR integration</strong>, reducing
rework and delays.
<br>
<br>By bridging the gap between innovation and adoption, the EMR Integration
Sandbox helps ideas move faster, safer, and more effectively into Singapore’s
healthcare ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong><em>Please note that while the sandbox simulates NGEMR for realistic testing, it does not guarantee production readiness, as integration with NGEMR in production may still require further reviews and alignment with operational and compliance standards.</em></strong>
</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The EMR Integration Sandbox is designed to:
<br>• Provide an overview of NGEMR and the pathway to integrate with it.
<br>• Offer a realistic EMR environment that simulates NGEMR for safe integration
testing.
<br>• Enable innovators to trial solutions with production-like interfaces,
building confidence before engaging the live system.</p>
<h3>Playbook on EMR integration</h3>
<p>This playbook serves as a practical guide for innovators, outlining the
steps to move from idea to production:
