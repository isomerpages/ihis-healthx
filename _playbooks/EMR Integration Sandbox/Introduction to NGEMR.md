<h3>What is NGEMR?</h3>
<p>The <strong>Next Generation Electronic Medical Record (NGEMR)</strong> is
Singapore’s national EMR platform, powered by the Epic system, and implemented
across the public healthcare clusters. NGEMR serves as the single, integrated
record for patient care, ensuring consistency, safety, and continuity across
institutions</p>
<h3>Integration Standards</h3>
<p>NGEMR supports integration through widely adopted healthcare data standards:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>HL7 v2</strong> – for clinical messaging and data exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)</strong> – for
modern, standards-based APIs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These standards enable external applications and systems to interoperate
securely with NGEMR.</p>
<h3>Testing Integration</h3>
<p>To test integrations with NGEMR, two main environments are available:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://fhir.epic.com/Documentation?docId=testpatients" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Sandbox</a> –
Provides access to Epic’s standard sandbox environment and APIs.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://apidocs.healthx.sg/ngemr" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">HealthX Innovation Sandbox APIs</a> –
A local environment that mirrors NGEMR with equivalent APIs, synthetic
data, and workflows for innovators to test safely.</p>
