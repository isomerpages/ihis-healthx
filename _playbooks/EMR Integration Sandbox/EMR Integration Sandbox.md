<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The <strong>Next Generation Electronic Medical Record (NGEMR)</strong> is
Singapore’s national Electronic Medical Record platform, built on the Epic
EMR system and used across public healthcare institutions. It is the backbone
for safe, seamless, and coordinated patient care.
<br>
</p>
<p>Yet, as a live production system, accessing NGEMR for testing and integration
is challenging:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It involves <strong>lengthy processes</strong> to safeguard system stability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It requires<strong> strict governance</strong> to ensure compliance with
national policies and security standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It demands <strong>tight technical requirements</strong>, including HL7,
FHIR, and Epic-specific interfaces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These necessary safeguards make early experimentation within NGEMR itself
difficult for innovators, startups, and industry partners.</p>
<p>This is where the <strong>EMR Integration Sandbox </strong>plays a crucial
role.</p>
<p>The Sandbox provides a safe, production-like environment that simulates
NGEMR, allowing innovators to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Experiment and test integrations </strong>without risk to live
operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Validate and refine solutions early</strong> using synthetic data
and realistic workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accelerate readiness</strong> for NGEMR integration, reducing rework
and delays.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By bridging the gap between innovation and adoption, the EMR Integration
Sandbox helps ideas move faster, safer, and more effectively into Singapore’s
healthcare ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The EMR Integration Sandbox is designed to:
<br>• Provide an overview of NGEMR and the pathway to integrate with it.
<br>• Offer a realistic EMR environment that simulates NGEMR for safe integration
testing.
<br>• Enable innovators to trial solutions with production-like interfaces,
building confidence before engaging the live system.</p>
<h3>Playbook on EMR integration</h3>
<p>This Playbook serves as a practical guide for innovators, outlining the
steps to move from idea to production:
