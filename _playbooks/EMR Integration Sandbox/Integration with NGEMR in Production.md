<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>Epic has multiple modules that may fulfill the business requirement. Integration
to NGEMR will be an option if the business requirements/workflow cannot
be met by Epic’s out-of-the box capability. User workflow and capability
of the external systems will be the required input to assess the right
integration option. Below is a high-level illustration of external systems
integration project with NGEMR. ​</p>
