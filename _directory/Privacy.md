<h4><strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><br>1. What Personal Data We Collect</a></strong></h4>
<p>"Personal Data" refers to any data, whether true or not, about an individual
who can be identified (a) from that data; or (b) from that data and other
information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access.
For example, "Mr ABC, 40 years old, talent acquisition manager, lives at
12 Ang Mo Kio Central 3" could constitute data that falls under (b). In
relation to Personal Data, "processing" refers to carrying out any operations
or set of operations on the Personal Data and including any recording,
holding, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, combination, transmission,
erasure or destruction of Personal Data.</p>
<p>The definition does not extend to (a) business contact information; (b)
Personal Data about an individual that is contained in a record that has
been in existence for at least 100 years; (c) Personal Data about a deceased
individual who has been dead for more than 10 years; or (d) anonymised
data. Anonymisation is the process of removing identifying information
such that the remaining data does not identify any particular individual.</p>
<p>The exact type of Personal Data that may apply in your case will vary
depending on how you have interacted with us. Some examples of such Personal
Data you may provide to us include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Personal details (e.g. name, NRIC, FIN, passport or other identification
number, contact details, residential address, personal email address, nationality,
medical history and background, and/or income levels);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Images and biometrics (e.g. photographs, voice and video recordings of
you, including our conversations with you, using fingerprint mapping and
facial recognition for verification or other purposes);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>employment details (e.g. occupation, directorships, and other positions
held, employment history, salary and/or benefits);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your personal opinions made known to us (e.g. through feedback or surveys);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other electronic data or information relating to you through your usage
of our products and services or as part of their delivery to you (e.g.
location data, IP address, activity logs, cookies, device carrier/operating
system and connection type); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(if you are an applicant for employment with us) past employment information
and/or curriculum vitae and any other information relating to you which
you have provided us.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2. How We Collect Your Data</a></strong></h4>
<p>Generally, we may collect your Personal Data in the following ways:</p>

<li>
<p>when you interact with us via any offline transactions such as counter

such information to us, you represent to us that you have obtained his/her/their
consent to provide us with their Personal Data for the respective purposes.</p>
<p>We also rely on you and will assume that you have ensured that all Personal
Data submitted to us is complete, accurate, true and correct.</p>
<p>If consents are not procured or if you fail to provide us with complete
and accurate information or withhold information, we may be unable to proceed
with a particular transaction, agreement or interaction with you. We will
take the approach that best safeguards us, you and others from risks, and
we may well have no choice but to decline to proceed with the transaction,
agreement or interaction in question to avoid causing harm or exposing
us, you or others to risk.</p>
