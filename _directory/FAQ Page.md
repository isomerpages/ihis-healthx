<p>Q: What does the innovation sandbox do and cover?</p>
<p>A:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HealthX Innovation Sandbox is a safe, self-contained and simulated production
cloud environment leveraging on existing Healthcare Commercial Cloud (“HCC”)
services where Public Healthcare Institutions (“PHIs”) or agencies and
industry partners can test their solutions isolated from the production
environment.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PHIs or any interested firms are free to ideate and conduct fast experimentation,
assessment and value demonstration for their innovation projects, as long
as they have carried out their due diligence and there is no breach of
regulatory requirements such as PDPA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How to qualify?</p>
<p>A:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Healthcare Institution or any interested firm can apply via Synapxe
<a href="https://for.sg/gibf27" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HealthX Ideas Submission</a>to participate in the HealthX Innovation Sandbox
to experiment with innovative technology for the healthcare services in
the production-like environment; operate within HCC, fulfil the baseline
security management requirement (such as no production data and system
to be hosted in the Sandbox environment) and short-term duration (&lt;
9 months from setup to deployment in sandbox environment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requestor to undergo onboarding, evaluation and approval process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon approval, the requestor becomes the entity responsible for deploying
and operating the sandbox (the “Project Team”) in Sandbox Enabling Environment
like HCC with customized infrastructure to support healthcare staff and
organisations.&nbsp; HCC platform is constructed upon the leading Cloud
Service Providers (“CSPs”), i.e., AWS for start.&nbsp; It enables the applications
to consume securely a broad range of cloud infrastructure and services
offered by AWS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: What do project team need to do?</p>
<p>A:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the “Application Stage”, the requestor should ensure that the objective
and general eligibility of the sandbox &nbsp;specified are satisfied.&nbsp;
The preliminary indication serves to help the requestor with its business
and resource planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the “Entry Evaluation Stage”, the requestor must submit a project proposal
with the project team composition and project information (including list
of CSP requirements or services required, solution architecture diagram,
and entry &amp; exit requirement for the project).&nbsp; Due to the exploratory
nature of the sandbox approach, the requestor is allowed to make adjustments
to the application for resubmission (for example, refining the boundary
conditions) after discussing with Synapxe.&nbsp;The requestor will be informed
in writing whether to proceed with the sandbox.&nbsp; Reason for rejection
could include failure to meet any of the entry evaluation criteria.&nbsp;
The requestor may re-apply for the sandbox when it is ready to meet the
entry evaluation criteria of the sandbox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon approval of the application, the sandbox is launched into the “Experimentation
Stage”. The requestor becomes the “sandbox entity / project team” responsible
for deploying and operating the sandbox; including engage managed services
for account setup, service access, configurations and deployment.&nbsp;
The project team must also ensure proper maintenance of records during
the experimentation period to facilitate reviews of sandbox testing and
expected outcomes with Synapxe HealthX Innovation Sandbox administrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the “Exit Evaluation Stage”, the project team must provide a report
to support the experimentation conclusion and exit outcome; whether to
extend or proceed to scale the newly validated ideas and technology under
experimentation in production to ‘graduate’ from the Sandbox or stop the
project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of the sandbox period, the project team must settle the HCC
billings, de-activate the account(s), teardown the workloads and exit from
the sandbox.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: What is the turnaround time?</p>
<p>A:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the “Application Stage” (i.e., after the application requests are submitted
to the HealthX Ideas Submission), Synapxe HealthX Innovation workgroup
shall review the application and endeavour to notify the requestor of its
potential suitability for a sandbox within 8 weeks after Synapxe receives
a complete set of information necessary for the assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the “Entry Evaluation Stage”, the time required to fully assess the
application is dependent on its completeness&nbsp; (and complexity, and
the specify policy and regulatory requirements involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the “Experimentation Stage”, the average turnaround time for the Service
Requests and handover the necessary permissions, service access to Project
Team to kick start the workload deployment and management is within 10
working days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How much does Health Commerical Cloud (HCC) cost?</p>
<p>A: The HCC Pricing and Cost Model is accessible by Synapxe personnel only.
