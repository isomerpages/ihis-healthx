### Privacy Policy

Integrated Health Information Systems Pte. Ltd. (collectively "IHiS", "us", "we" or "our") are committed to protecting the rights and privacy of individuals in accordance with the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the "PDPA").  

This policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how we may collect, use, disclose, process and manage your Personal Data in the course of our business, including our websites, services and products such as mobile applications, technical platforms, and other online or offline offerings otherwise indicated. This policy applies to any individual's Personal Data which is in our possession or under our control.  

This Privacy Policy was last updated on&nbsp;the date shown at the end of this&nbsp;Privacy Policy. If you have any queries related to this Privacy Policy, please contact the persons identified at the end of this Privacy Policy.  

  

1\. What Personal Data We Collect  

------------------------------------

"Personal Data" refers to any data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified (a) from that data; or (b) from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access. For example, "Mr ABC, 40 years old, talent acquisition manager, lives at 12 Ang Mo Kio Central 3" could constitute data that falls under (b). In relation to Personal Data, "processing" refers to carrying out any operations or set of operations on the Personal Data and including any recording, holding, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, combination, transmission, erasure or destruction of Personal Data. &nbsp;  

The definition does not extend to (a) business contact information; (b) Personal Data about an individual that is contained in a record that has been in existence for at least 100 years; (c) Personal Data about a deceased individual who has been dead for more than 10 years; or (d) anonymised data. Anonymisation is the process of removing identifying information such that the remaining data does not identify any particular individual.  

The exact type of Personal Data that may apply in your case will vary depending on how you have interacted with us. Some examples of such Personal Data you may provide to us include:  

*   Personal details (e.g. name, NRIC, FIN, passport or other identification number, contact details, residential address, personal email address, nationality, medical history and background, and/or income levels);
*   images and biometrics (e.g. photographs, voice and video recordings of you, including our conversations with you, using fingerprint mapping and facial recognition for verification or other purposes);
*   employment details (e.g. occupation, directorships, and other positions held, employment history, salary and/or benefits);
*   your personal opinions made known to us (e.g. through feedback or surveys);
*   other electronic data or information relating to you through your usage of our products and services or as part of their delivery to you (e.g. location data, IP address, activity logs, cookies, device carrier/operating system and connection type); and
*   (if you are an applicant for employment with us) past employment information and/or curriculum vitae and any other information relating to you which you have provided us.
